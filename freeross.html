<p style="text-align:center"><b>Silk Road Museum</b> is a reconstruction of the marketplace created by Ross Ulbricht in 2011 and a plea for his freedom after more than 10 years of incarceration.
<br>
<br>
Ross Ulbricht has been sentenced to life imprisonment. Not denying his actions should carry criminal consequences, but it is a disproportionate punishment.
<br>
<br>
This site is one of the many small gestures of support for his freedom, it will never be functional, just a memory. Feel free to participate on <a href="https://github.com/galetaire/SilkRoadMuseum" target="_blank">github</a>.
<br>
<br>
Ross can still generate many positive things for society. Support Ross pardon and spread the word at:
