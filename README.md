## Description and contact

Silk Road Museum is a reconstruction of the online marketplace created by Ross Ulbricht in 2011 and a plea for his freedom after more than 10 years of incarceration.

Not disputing the ethics of sanctioning the creation of an illegal black market, Ross Ulbricht has been sentenced to life imprisonment. An abusive punishment he does not deserve.

This repository is one of the many small gestures of support for his freedom. Feel free to improve this website, it will never be functional, just a memory.

Ross can still generate many positive things for society. If you want to support Ross pardon, support https://freeross.org/ and spread the word shown on his twitter account: https://twitter.com/realrossu
